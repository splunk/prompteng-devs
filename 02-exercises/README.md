## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Complete [01-tutorials/](../01-tutorials/) modules 1-2 minimum
- Python 3.8+ with virtual environment set up
- API access configured (GitHub Copilot preferred)
- IDE with notebook support (VS Code or Cursor recommended)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Environment**: Ensure your `.venv` is activated and dependencies installed
2. **API Configuration**: Run the appropriate setup script:
   - For GitHub Copilot: `python github_copilot_setup.py`
   - For CircuIT: `python circuit_setup.py`
3. **Open Exercises**: Launch `hands-on/prompt-engineering-exercises.ipynb`

### Assessment Approach
- **Self-Guided Learning**: Work through exercises at your own pace
- **Compare Solutions**: Check your work against reference solutions
- **Iterate and Improve**: Refine prompts based on output quality and consistency
- **Apply to Real Work**: Adapt patterns to your actual development tasks

## Exercise Flow

1. **Read Objective** - Understand what you're practicing and why
2. **Follow Instructions** - Complete the guided tasks step-by-step  
3. **Execute and Evaluate** - Run your prompts and assess the results
4. **Compare Solutions** - Review reference implementations and explanations
5. **Reflect and Adapt** - Consider how to apply these patterns in your work

## Assessment Criteria

Each exercise includes specific success criteria:
- **Functional Requirements** - Does the output meet the specified requirements?
- **Quality Standards** - Is the response accurate, relevant, and well-structured?
- **Consistency** - Do repeated executions produce reliable results?
- **Practical Value** - Can this pattern be applied to real development tasks?

## Next Steps

After completing exercises, explore:
- **[03-examples/](../03-examples/)** - Real-world implementation patterns and use cases
- **Production Integration** - Apply learned patterns to your actual development workflow
- **Team Adoption** - Share effective patterns with your development team
