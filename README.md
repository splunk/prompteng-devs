Master prompting techniques for software development with structured tutorials, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples.

## üöÄ Get Started

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:splunk/prompteng-devs.git
cd prompteng-devs
```

**2. Begin learning:**
- **[Start Module 1: Foundations](./01-course/module-01-foundations/)** ‚Üê Read README.md, then open the `.ipynb` notebook
- **[View All Modules](./01-course/)** ‚Üê Browse the complete course
- **[Implementation Examples](./02-implementation-examples/)** ‚Üê Production patterns

---

## üéØ Recommended Learning Workflow

> **üìö For Each Module:**

#### **Step 1: üìñ Read the Module**
- Open the module's `README.md` file to understand learning objectives and prerequisites

#### **Step 2: üöÄ Launch the Notebook** 
- Open the `.ipynb` notebook file to begin the interactive tutorial

#### **Step 3: üíª Complete All Cells**
- Run through each cell sequentially from top to bottom

#### **Step 4: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Practice Exercises**
- Complete the hands-on exercises to reinforce learning

#### **Step 5: üìä Self-Assess**
- Use the Skills Checklist in the notebook to track your progress

#### **Step 6: ‚û°Ô∏è Next Module**
- Move to the next module and repeat the process

**üìà Track Progress**: Use the Skills Checklist in each notebook to mark skills as you master them
**üöÄ Apply Skills**: Use real-world examples after completing all modules

üí° **Tip**: Each module directory contains a `README.md` file explaining what you'll learn and how to get started.

## ‚ö° Quick Setup

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.8+, IDE with notebook support, API access (GitHub Copilot/CircuIT/OpenAI)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:splunk/prompteng-devs.git
cd prompteng-devs

# 2. Install dependencies
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv .venv --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install ipykernel

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env-example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

**Splunk users**: Run `okta-artifactory-login -t pypi` before installing dependencies.

## üìì About Jupyter Notebooks

> **üÜï First time using Jupyter notebooks?** Read this section before starting the modules.

All course modules use **Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb` files) - interactive documents that let you run code directly in your IDE.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Requirements

<div style="padding:12px; background:#fee2e2; border-left:4px solid #ef4444; color:#991b1b;">

**You must clone this repository and run notebooks locally.** They cannot be executed directly from GitHub.

</div>

### üí° How Notebooks Work

- **Code cells** contain Python code that runs on your local machine
- **Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button** (or press `Shift + Enter`) to execute a cell
- **Output appears** below each cell after you run it
- **To edit cells**: Double-click to edit, make changes (like uncommenting code), then press `Shift + Enter` to run
- **Installation commands** run locally and install packages to your Python environment
- **You don't copy/paste** - just click the run button in each cell
- **Long outputs are truncated**: If you see "Output is truncated. View as a scrollable element" - click that link to see the full response

### üîí Where Code Executes

All code runs on your local machine. When you:
- Install packages ‚Üí They're installed to your Python environment
- Connect to AI services ‚Üí Your computer sends requests over the internet to those services
- Run API calls ‚Üí They execute from your machine using your credentials

### üöÄ Getting Started with Notebooks

1. **Open the `.ipynb` file** in your IDE (VS Code or Cursor recommended)
2. **Select the Python kernel**: Choose your `.venv` interpreter when prompted
3. **Run cells sequentially** from top to bottom
4. **Complete exercises** as you go through the modules
5. **Experiment**: Add new cells to try your own code

## üìä Tracking Your Progress

Each module includes a **Skills Checklist** to help you track your mastery of prompt engineering techniques.

### How It Works

Each module notebook has **two sections** for tracking progress:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Progress Overview** (Visual Status Only - Not Interactive)
- Shows automatic status: Tutorial completion and overall progress
- These checkmarks (‚úÖ/‚¨ú) are **visual indicators only** - you cannot click them
- Automatically shows ‚úÖ for "Tutorial Completed" after you finish all cells
- The ‚¨ú for "Skills Mastery" reminds you to use the Skills Checklist below

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Off Your Skills** (Interactive Checkboxes - This is Where You Track!)
- Contains **clickable checkboxes** for each individual skill
- **This is where you actively track your mastery** as you learn
- Check off each skill as you achieve it (see criteria below)
- Your progress percentage updates automatically based on checked skills

### When to Check Off a Skill

‚úÖ You can confidently apply the technique without referring back to examples  
‚úÖ You understand why and when to use the technique  
‚úÖ You can explain the technique to a colleague  
‚úÖ You've successfully used it in your own coding tasks  

üí° **Important**: The interactive checkboxes are in the "**Check Off Your Skills**" section. Don't worry if you can't click the status indicators in "Progress Overview" - those are just visual guides!

üí° **Tip**: Don't rush to check off skills. The goal is genuine mastery, not completion speed. Come back and practice skills until you feel confident.

## üìö Learning Path

### 1. **Interactive Course** - Learn the fundamentals
- **[Module 1: Foundations](./01-course/module-01-foundations/)** - Interactive notebook (`.ipynb`) with environment setup & prompt anatomy (20 min)
- **[Module 2: Core Techniques](./01-course/module-02-fundamentals/)** - Interactive notebook (`.ipynb`) with role prompting, structured inputs, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought reasoning, reference citations, prompt chaining, and evaluation techniques (90-120 min)  
- **[Module 3: Applications](./01-course/module-03-applications/)** - Interactive notebook (`.ipynb`) with code quality, testing, debugging (30 min)
- **[Module 4: Integration](./01-course/module-04-integration/)** - Interactive notebook (`.ipynb`) with custom commands & AI assistants (10 min)

### 2. **Practice** - Reinforce learning
- **Hands-on Exercises** - Integrated into each module to reinforce concepts
- **Self-Assessment** - Use the Skills Checklist in each module to track your progress

### 3. **Apply** - Real-world patterns
- **[Code Quality](./02-implementation-examples/code-quality/)** - Refactoring & modernization
- **[Debugging](./02-implementation-examples/debugging/)** - Incident investigation & resolution
- **[API Integration](./02-implementation-examples/api-integration/)** - Client generation & error handling
- **[Custom Commands](./02-implementation-examples/custom-commands/)** - Reusable templates


## üéØ What You'll Build

- ‚úÖ **Working Development Environment** with AI assistant integration
- ‚úÖ **Prompt Engineering Toolkit** with reusable patterns and commands  
- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready Workflows** for code quality, debugging, and API integration

**Total Time**: ~300 minutes (~4-5 hours)
