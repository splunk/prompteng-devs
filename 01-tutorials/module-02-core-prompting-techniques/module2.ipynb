        "\n",
        "1. **Role Prompting**: Assign specific expertise roles (security engineer, QA engineer, etc.) for specialized analysis\n",
        "2. **Delimiters**: Use `###` or `<xml>` tags to organize complex inputs with multiple files/requirements\n",
        "3. **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide 2-3 examples to teach the AI your preferred response style\n",
        "4. **Chain-of-Thought**: Break complex tasks into numbered steps for systematic processing\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Issue: \"Persona responses are too generic\"\n",
        "**Solution**: \n",
        "1. Be more specific about the role (e.g., \"senior Python security engineer\" vs \"engineer\")\n",
        "2. Add specific output requirements (\"provide exactly 3 recommendations\")\n",
        "3. Include context about the expertise level needed\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Issue: \"Delimiters aren't working properly\"\n",
        "**Solution**: \n",
        "1. Make sure delimiters are unique and consistent (use `###` or `<xml>` consistently)\n",
        "2. Always close XML-style delimiters (`<code>...</code>`)\n",
        "3. Test with simpler examples first before adding complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Issue: \"AI isn't following the step-by-step process\"\n",
        "**Solution**: \n",
        "1. Number your steps clearly (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)\n",
        "2. Specify output format for each step (\"with a prefix that says...\")\n",
        "3. Keep steps focused and specific rather than too broad\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Issue: \"Few-shot examples aren't being followed\"\n",
        "**Solution**: \n",
        "1. Provide 2-3 consistent examples, not just one\n",
        "2. Make sure examples clearly demonstrate the pattern you want\n",
        "3. Use the system message to explicitly state \"follow the pattern shown\"\n",
