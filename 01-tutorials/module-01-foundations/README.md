# Module 1: Foundations

## Course Introduction & Environment Setup

This foundational module introduces you to prompt engineering concepts and gets your development environment configured for hands-on learning.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will:
- ✅ Set up a working development environment with AI assistant access
- ✅ Identify and apply the four core elements of effective prompts
- ✅ Write basic prompts for code improvement and documentation
- ✅ Iterate and refine prompts based on output quality

### Getting Started

**First time here?** If you haven't set up your development environment yet, follow the [Quick Setup guide](../../README.md#-quick-setup) in the main README first.

**Ready to start?**
1. **Open the tutorial notebook**: Click on [module1.ipynb](./module1.ipynb) to start the interactive tutorial
2. **Install dependencies**: Run the "Install Required Dependencies" cell in the notebook
3. **Follow the notebook**: Work through each cell sequentially - the notebook will guide you through setup and exercises
4. **Complete exercises**: Practice the hands-on activities as you go

### Module Contents
