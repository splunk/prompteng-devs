    "## Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals for Developers** course is designed to equip engineers with the foundational knowledge and practical skills in Large Language Model (LLM) interaction patterns and best practices. It focuses on the core techniques required to design and optimize effective LLM prompts for various during various stages of SDLC. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience:  \n",
    "\n",
    "All engineers within the Products & Technology organization who are keen to develop or enhance their foundational prompt engineering skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful completion of this course, engineers will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up and configure a local development environment for executing prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply foundational prompting techniques—zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought—to create clear instructions for accurate LLM responses in software engineering tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Craft advanced prompt structures—role prompting, delimiters, and reference text—to reduce hallucinations in software engineering tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Write effective prompts for software engineering tasks that support code quality, testing, and API integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Integrate prompt-based slash commands for code review, branch analysis, and performance debugging with OpenAI Codex or Claude Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python is recommended, but experienced software developers with proficiency in another programming language will be able to follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "- API Access: Prefer CircuIT APIs (any tier) for this course. If you do not have CircuIT access, you can use GitHub Copilot via the local API proxy. Follow `GitHub-Copilot-2-API/README.md` to authenticate and start the local server, then run the \"GitHub Copilot (local proxy)\" setup cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Development Environment: A local development setup is necessary, including Python, IDE (VS Code or Cursor) with their built-in notebook support.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Claude Code or OpenAI Codex access to implement custom command integration. \n",

    "- Replace \"Hi there\" with the client's name for personalization\n",
    "- Replace \"some stuff\" with specific meeting topics discussed\n",

      "SPECIFIC REQUEST RESULT:\n",
      "Based on your requirements, here are my top 3 recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Node.js** (Recommended)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- **Excellent concurrency**: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O perfect for real-time applications\n",
      "- **WebSocket support**: Native support via Socket.io for real-time communication\n",
      "- **PostgreSQL integration**: Mature libraries (pg, Prisma, TypeORM)\n",
      "- **AWS deployment**: First-class support with Lambda, EC2, ECS, and Elastic Beanstalk\n",
      "- **Learning curve**: Easiest transition for web developers (JavaScript familiarity)\n",
      "- **Ecosystem**: Massive npm ecosystem with chat-specific libraries\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- **CPU-intensive tasks**: Single-threaded nature can be limiting for heavy computations\n",
      "- **Memory usage**: Can be memory-intensive with many concurrent connections\n",
      "- **Callback complexity**: Potential for callback hell (mitigated with async/await)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Go** \n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- **Superior concurrency**: Goroutines handle 10k+ connections efficiently with minimal overhead\n",
      "- **Performance**: Compiled language with excellent memory management\n",
      "- **PostgreSQL support**: Strong database libraries (pgx, GORM)\n",
      "- **AWS deployment**: Great containerization support, works well with ECS/EKS\n",
      "- **Reliability**: Strong typing and built-in error handling\n",
      "- **WebSocket libraries**: Good real-time communication support (Gorilla WebSocket)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- **Learning curve**: Steeper learning curve for web developers new to Go\n",
      "- **Ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js\n",
      "- **Development speed**: May require more initial development time\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Python (FastAPI/asyncio)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- **Familiar syntax**: Easy learning curve for most developers\n",
      "- **Async support**: Modern async/await with asyncio for concurrent handling\n",
      "- **PostgreSQL integration**: Excellent ORM options (SQLAlchemy, Tortoise ORM)\n",
      "- **AWS deployment**: Good support with various deployment options\n",
      "- **WebSocket support**: Built-in WebSocket support in FastAPI\n",
      "- **Rapid development**: Quick prototyping and development\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- **Performance**: Generally slower than Go and Node.js for I/O-heavy operations\n",
      "- **GIL limitations**: Global Interpreter Lock can limit true parallelism\n",
      "- **Memory usage**: Higher memory footprint compared to Go\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Final Recommendation**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Choose Node.js** for your use case. Given your team's web development background and the real-time nature of chat applications, Node.js offers the best balance of performance, ease of development, and ecosystem support. Socket.io makes real-time features straightforward, and the AWS deployment options are mature and well-documented.\n",

    "# Module 4: AI Code Assistant Integration\n",
    "## Why Code Assistants Excel with Structured Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompt engineering transforms AI code assistants from basic code generators into sophisticated development partners. Research shows that well-structured prompts can improve code quality by 40-60% and reduce error rates by up to 35% compared to unstructured requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Structured Prompt Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "When interacting with AI code assistants like OpenAI Codex, Claude, or GitHub Copilot, structured prompts provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Context Processing** - AI models process and retain information more effectively when presented in organized formats\n",
    "- **Reduced Ambiguity** - Clear specifications minimize misinterpretations and assumptions\n",
    "- **Consistent Mental Models** - Well-structured prompts help the AI build more accurate representations of your requirements\n",
    "- **Improved Problem Decomposition** - Systematic approaches help tackle complex problems more effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool-Calling Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI code assistants provide advanced tool-calling capabilities not available when using LLMs directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File System Integration** - Reading, writing, and modifying code files directly\n",
    "- **Code Execution** - Running code and returning results within the prompt context\n",
    "- **Contextual Analysis** - Analyzing entire codebases and repository structures\n",
    "- **Extended Intelligence** - Accessing external tools and APIs for enhanced functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "These capabilities can be further extended by integrating various MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers, allowing teams to connect specialized tools for their development workflows.\n",
