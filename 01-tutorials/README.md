# 01-tutorials: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

This directory contains comprehensive tutorials that teach the fundamentals of prompt engineering for developers through hands-on examples and progressive learning modules.

## Structure

### Core Modules

- **[prompt-engineering-for-developers.ipynb](./prompt-engineering-for-developers.ipynb)** - Complete course material with all modules in one comprehensive notebook
- **[module-01-foundations/](./module-01-foundations/)** - Course introduction, environment setup, and prompt anatomy
- **[module-02-fundamentals/](./module-02-fundamentals/)** - Core prompting techniques: clear instructions, personas, delimiters, reasoning
- **[module-03-applications/](./module-03-applications/)** - Software engineering applications: code quality, testing, debugging, API integration
- **[module-04-integration/](./module-04-integration/)** - Custom command integration for AI code assistants

## Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: Begin with any individual module notebook or the comprehensive course notebook
2. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.8+, IDE with notebook support, API access (GitHub Copilot, CircuIT, or OpenAI)
3. **Time Required**: ~90 minutes total, can be completed in 30-minute sessions
4. **Practice**: Complete hands-on exercises in [02-exercises/](../02-exercises/)
