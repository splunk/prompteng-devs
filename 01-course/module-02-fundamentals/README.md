# Module 2: Fundamentals

## Core Prompt Engineering Techniques

This module covers the essential prompt engineering techniques that form the foundation of effective AI assistant interaction for software development.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:

- ✅ Apply six core prompt engineering techniques to real coding scenarios
- ✅ Transform vague requests into specific, actionable prompts
- ✅ Structure complex multi-file refactoring tasks systematically
- ✅ Guide AI assistants through systematic code analysis
- ✅ Write clear instructions with specific constraints and requirements
- ✅ Use role prompting to leverage specialized engineering expertise
- ✅ Organize complex inputs using delimiters and structured formatting
- ✅ Implement step-by-step reasoning for systematic problem-solving
- ✅ Provide examples and reference text to improve AI accuracy
