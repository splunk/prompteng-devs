# Module 2: Fundamentals

## Core Prompt Engineering Techniques

This module covers the essential prompt engineering techniques that form the foundation of effective AI assistant interaction for software development.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:

- âœ… Apply eight core prompt engineering techniques to real coding scenarios
- âœ… Write clear instructions with specific constraints and requirements
- âœ… Use role prompting to transform AI into specialized domain experts
- âœ… Organize complex inputs using XML delimiters and structured formatting
- âœ… Teach AI your preferred styles using few-shot examples
- âœ… Implement chain-of-thought reasoning for systematic problem-solving
- âœ… Ground AI responses in reference texts with proper citations
- âœ… Break complex tasks into sequential workflows using prompt chaining
- âœ… Create evaluation rubrics and self-critique loops with LLM-as-Judge
- âœ… Separate reasoning from clean final outputs using inner monologue

### Getting Started

**First time here?** If you haven't set up your development environment yet, follow the [Quick Setup guide](../../README.md#-quick-setup) in the main README first.

**Ready to start?**
1. **Open the tutorial notebook**: Click on [module2.ipynb](./module2.ipynb) to start the interactive tutorial
2. **Install dependencies**: Run the "Install Required Dependencies" cell in the notebook
3. **Follow the notebook**: Work through each cell sequentially - the notebook will guide you through setup and exercises
4. **Complete exercises**: Practice the hands-on activities as you go

### Module Contents
- **[module2.ipynb](./module2.ipynb)** - Complete module 2 tutorial notebook

### Time Required
Approximately 90-120 minutes (1.5-2 hours)

**Time Breakdown:**
- Setup and introduction: ~10 minutes
- 8 core tactics with examples: ~70 minutes
- Hands-on practice activities: ~20-30 minutes
- Progress tracking: ~5 minutes

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can complete this module in one session or break it into multiple shorter sessions. Each tactic is self-contained, making it easy to pause and resume.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- IDE with notebook support (VS Code or Cursor recommended)
- API access to GitHub Copilot, CircuIT, or OpenAI

### Next Steps
After completing this module:
1. Review and refine your solutions to the exercises in this module 
2. Continue to [Module 3: Application in Software Engineering](../module-03-applications/)
