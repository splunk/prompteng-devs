# Module 2: Fundamentals

## Core Prompt Engineering Techniques

This module covers the essential prompt engineering techniques that form the foundation of effective AI assistant interaction for software development.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:

- ‚úÖ Apply eight core prompt engineering techniques to real coding scenarios
- ‚úÖ Write clear instructions with specific constraints and requirements
- ‚úÖ Use role prompting to transform AI into specialized domain experts
- ‚úÖ Organize complex inputs using XML delimiters and structured formatting
- ‚úÖ Teach AI your preferred styles using few-shot examples
- ‚úÖ Implement chain-of-thought reasoning for systematic problem-solving
- ‚úÖ Ground AI responses in reference texts with proper citations
- ‚úÖ Break complex tasks into sequential workflows using prompt chaining
- ‚úÖ Create evaluation rubrics and self-critique loops with LLM-as-Judge
- ‚úÖ Separate reasoning from clean final outputs using inner monologue

### Getting Started

**First time here?** If you haven't set up your development environment yet, follow the [Quick Setup guide](../../README.md#-quick-setup) in the main README first.

**Ready to start?**
1. **Launch Section 2.1**: Open [2.1-setup-and-foundations.ipynb](./2.1-setup-and-foundations.ipynb) to configure your environment.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run the "Install Required Dependencies" cell in Section 2.1 before moving on.
3. **Work sequentially**: Continue through Sections 2.2 ‚Üí 2.5 in order; each notebook builds on the last.
4. **Practice as you go**: Complete the embedded ‚ÄúTry It Yourself‚Äù prompts and activities in every notebook.

### Module Contents
- **[2.1-setup-and-foundations.ipynb](./2.1-setup-and-foundations.ipynb)** ‚Äî environment setup, breakpoint workflows, and Tactic 0
- **[2.2-roles-and-structure.ipynb](./2.2-roles-and-structure.ipynb)** ‚Äî role prompting personas and structured input patterns
- **[2.3-patterns-for-reasoning.ipynb](./2.3-patterns-for-reasoning.ipynb)** ‚Äî few-shot exemplars, chain-of-thought, and reference citations
- **[2.4-automation-and-evaluation.ipynb](./2.4-automation-and-evaluation.ipynb)** ‚Äî prompt chaining, self-correction loops, and LLM-as-judge tactics
- **[2.5-hands-on-practice.ipynb](./2.5-hands-on-practice.ipynb)** ‚Äî unguided practice with automated evaluation and skill tracking

### Automated Evaluation System

Section 2.5 features an **AI-powered evaluation system** to help you master the 8 tactics:

**How it works:**
1. Complete each practice activity independently
2. Write your prompt and test it
3. Run the `evaluate_prompt()` function to get instant feedback
4. Review your score (0-100) and tactical analysis
5. Earn skills when you score ‚â• 80

**What gets evaluated:**
- ‚úÖ Correct use of required tactics (Role Prompting, XML tags, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Prompt structure and organization
- ‚úÖ Completeness (all necessary components present)
- ‚úÖ Overall quality and effectiveness

**Skill Tracking:** Each activity maps to specific skills. Score ‚â• 80 to check off:
- **Activity 2.1** ‚Üí Skills #1-4 (Role Prompting & Structured Inputs)
- **Activity 2.2** ‚Üí Skills #5-8 (Few-Shot & Chain-of-Thought)
- **Activity 2.3** ‚Üí Skills #9-12 (Reference Citations & Prompt Chaining)
- **Activity 2.4** ‚Üí Skills #13-16 (LLM-as-Judge & Inner Monologue)

üí° **Tip:** Don't worry about perfect scores on the first try! Use the feedback to iterate and improve your prompts.

### Time Required
Approximately 90-120 minutes (1.5-2 hours)

**Time Breakdown:**
- Setup and introduction: ~10 minutes
- 8 core tactics with examples: ~70 minutes
- Hands-on practice with evaluation: ~20-30 minutes
- Review and iteration: ~10 minutes

üí° **Tip:** You can complete this module in one session or break it into multiple shorter sessions. Each tactic is self-contained, making it easy to pause and resume.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- IDE with notebook support (VS Code or Cursor recommended)
- API access to GitHub Copilot, CircuIT, or OpenAI

### Next Steps
After completing this module:
1. Review and refine your solutions to the exercises in this module 
2. Continue to [Module 3: Application in Software Engineering](../module-03-applications/)
