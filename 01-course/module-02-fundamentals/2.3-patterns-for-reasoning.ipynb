    "\n",
    "**Guide AI through systematic step-by-step problem breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:** When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, having AI models break down problems into explicit, sequential steps dramatically improves performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages the AI to work through problems methodically rather than jumping straight to conclusions, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like showing your work in math class‚Äîby making the intermediate reasoning steps visible, you catch errors, verify logic, and produce more reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Breaking problems into steps reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or complex tasks with multiple considerations\n",
    "- **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses  \n",
    "- **Debugging:** Seeing the AI's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear or where reasoning breaks down\n",
    "- **Transparency:** Makes AI decision-making auditable and explainable\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use CoT:**\n",
    "- Use for tasks that a human would need to think through carefully\n",
    "- Examples: complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, decisions with many factors\n",
    "- Especially valuable for: debugging workflows, architectural decisions, security analysis, test generation\n",
    "- **Note:** Increased output length may impact latency, so use judiciously\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Implement CoT (from least to most complex):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic prompt:** Include \"Think step-by-step\" in your prompt\n",
    "2. **Guided prompt:** Outline specific steps for the AI to follow in its thinking process  \n",
    "3. **Structured prompt:** Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Always have the AI output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples Below:** This section demonstrates three CoT patterns: forcing evaluation after solving, systematic multi-step code analysis, and a comprehensive review combining multiple techniques.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ground responses in actual documentation to reduce hallucinations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:** When working with long documents or multiple reference materials, asking AI models to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out tasks helps them cut through the \"noise\" and focus on pertinent information. This technique is especially powerful when working with extended context windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- The AI identifies and focuses on relevant information before generating responses\n",
    "- Citations make outputs verifiable and trustworthy\n",
    "- Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in actual source material\n",
    "- Makes it easy to trace conclusions back to specific code or documentation sections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices for Long Context:**\n",
    "- **Put longform data at the top:** Place long documents (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above queries and instructions (can improve response quality by up to 30%)\n",
    "- **Structure with XML tags:** Use `<documents>`, `<document>`, `<source>`, and `<document_content>` tags to organize multiple documents\n",
    "- **Request quotes first:** Ask the AI to extract relevant quotes in `<quotes>` tags before generating the final response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working with External Documentation in IDEs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI coding assistants like **GitHub Copilot**, **Claude Code**, or **OpenAI Codex**, you often need to reference documentation outside your codebase. Here's how to provide context effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Structure documents with XML tags (Recommended):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this format for local files or external documentation. Keep a `docs/` folder with frequently-used references:\n",
    "- `docs/api-conventions.md` - Your team's API standards\n",
    "- `docs/external-apis/stripe.md` - Third-party API summaries  \n",
    "- `docs/architecture.md` - System design decisions\n",
    "- `docs/error-codes.md` - Standard error codes and handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Then reference them in your prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<documents>\n",
    "  <document index=\"1\">\n",
    "    <source>docs/api-guide.md</source>\n",
    "    <document_content>\n",
    "    # Stripe Payment API\n",
    "    POST /v1/payment_intents\n",
    "    Creates a PaymentIntent object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Required fields:\n",
    "    - amount (integer): Amount in cents\n",
    "    - currency (string): 3-letter ISO code\n",
    "    </document_content>\n",
    "  </document>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <document index=\"2\">\n",
    "    <source>docs/authentication.md</source>\n",
    "    <document_content>\n",
    "    Authentication uses Bearer tokens in the Authorization header.\n",
    "    Example: Authorization: Bearer sk_test_abc123\n",
    "    </document_content>\n",
    "  </document>\n",
    "</documents>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the documentation above, implement a payment creation function.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. IDE-specific file shortcuts:**\n",
    "- **GitHub Copilot Chat:** Use `#file:docs/api-guide.md` to quickly reference specific files\n",
    "- **Claude Code:** Use `@filename` (e.g., `@docs/api-guide.md`) or open files in your editor as context\n",
    "- **VS Code with Copilot:** Use `@workspace` or keep documentation files open in tabs\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reference external URLs with key excerpts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For web documentation, extract and structure the relevant parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<document>\n",
    "  <source>https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents</source>\n",
    "  <document_content>\n",
    "  Key requirements:\n",
    "  - Authentication: Bearer token in Authorization header  \n",
    "  - amount must be in cents (e.g., $10.00 = 1000)\n",
    "  - currency must be 3-letter ISO code\n",
    "  - Successful response returns 200 with payment_intent object\n",
    "  </document_content>\n",
    "</document>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** Maintain local markdown summaries of frequently-used external APIs in your repo. This gives AI assistants grounded reference material and prevents hallucination of API details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code review with large codebases, documentation generation from source files, security audit reports, and analyzing API documentation all become more effective with proper citations.\n",
