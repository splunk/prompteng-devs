# Module 1: Foundations

## Course Introduction & Environment Setup

This foundational module introduces you to prompt engineering concepts and gets your development environment configured for hands-on learning.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- ✅ Set up a working development environment with AI assistant access
- ✅ Identify and apply the four core elements of effective prompts
- ✅ Write basic prompts for reviewing code
- ✅ Iterate and refine prompts based on output quality

### Getting Started

**First time here?** 
- If you haven't set up your development environment yet, follow the [Quick Setup guide](../../README.md#-quick-setup) in the main README first
- **New to Jupyter notebooks?** Read [About Jupyter Notebooks](../../README.md#-about-jupyter-notebooks) to understand how notebooks work and where code executes

**Ready to start?**
1. **Open the tutorial notebook**: Click on [module1.ipynb](./module1.ipynb) to start the interactive tutorial
2. **Install dependencies**: Run the "Install Required Dependencies" cell in the notebook
3. **Follow the notebook**: Work through each cell sequentially - the notebook will guide you through setup and exercises
4. **Complete exercises**: Practice the hands-on activities as you go

### Module Contents
- **[module1.ipynb](./module1.ipynb)** - Complete module 1 tutorial notebook

### Time Required
Approximately 20 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- IDE with notebook support (VS Code or Cursor recommended)
- API access to GitHub Copilot, CircuIT, or OpenAI

### Next Steps
After completing this module:
1. Review and refine your solutions to the exercises in this module
2. Continue to [Module 2: Core Prompting Techniques](../module-02-fundamentals/)
