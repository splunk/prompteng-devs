    "## 🤔 Why Prompt Engineering for Software Engineers?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Engineering** is the fastest way to harness the power of large language models. By interacting with an LLM through a series of questions, statements, or instructions, you can adjust LLM output behavior based on the specific context of the output you want to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effective prompt techniques can help your business accomplish the following benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boost a model's abilities and improve safety**\n",
    "- **Augment the model with domain knowledge and external tools** without changing model parameters or fine-tuning\n",
    "- **Interact with language models to grasp their full capabilities**\n",
    "- **Achieve better quality outputs through better quality inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Ways to Influence LLM Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Fine-tuning (Traditional Approach)**\n",
    "- Adjust the model's weights/parameters using training data to optimize a cost function\n",
    "- **Expensive process** - requires significant computation time and cost\n",
    "- **Limited flexibility** - model is locked into specific behavior patterns\n",
    "- **Problem:** Still produces vague, inconsistent results without proper context\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Anthropic's engineering team](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents), there's an important distinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering** refers to methods for writing and organizing LLM instructions for optimal outcomes\n",
    "- **Context Engineering** refers to the set of strategies for curating and maintaining the optimal set of tokens (information) during LLM inference, including all the other information that may land there outside of the prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:** Prompt engineering focuses on writing effective prompts, while context engineering manages the entire context state (system instructions, tools, external data, message history, etc.) as a finite resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Evolution: From Prompting to Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Prompting** is asking AI questions without providing sufficient context, leading to generic, unhelpful responses. It's like asking a doctor \"fix me\" without describing your symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Engineering** treats context as a finite resource that must be carefully curated. As [Anthropic explains](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents), \"context is a critical but finite resource for AI agents\" that requires thoughtful management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Engineering** focuses on writing effective instructions, while **Context Engineering** manages the entire information ecosystem that feeds into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Traditional Prompting** | **Context Engineering** | **Prompt Engineering** |\n",
    "|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n",

    "## 📋 Elements of a Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt's form depends on the task you are giving to a model. As you explore prompt engineering examples, you will review prompts containing some or all of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Instructions**\n",
    "This is a task for the large language model to do. It provides a task description or instruction for how the model should perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"You are a senior software engineer conducting a code review. Analyze the provided code and identify potential issues.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Context**\n",
    "This is external information to guide the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Code context: This is a utility function for user registration in a web application.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Input Data**\n",
    "This is the input for which you want a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Code to review: `def register_user(email, password): ...`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Output Indicator**\n",
    "This is the output type or format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Please provide your response in this format: 1) Security Issues, 2) Code Quality Issues, 3) Recommended Improvements, 4) Overall Assessment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Evaluate and Iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review model responses** to ensure prompts elicit appropriate quality, type, and range of responses. Make changes as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip:** Ask one copy of the model to improve or check output from another copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Prompt engineering is an iterative skill that improves with practice. Experimentation builds intuition for crafting optimal prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Benefits of Effective Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompt techniques can help you accomplish the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🚀 Boost a model's abilities and improve safety**  \n",
    "  Well-crafted prompts guide models toward more accurate and appropriate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🧠 Augment the model with domain knowledge and external tools**  \n",
    "  Without changing model parameters or fine-tuning\n",

    "- **💡 Interact with language models to grasp their full capabilities**  \n",
    "  Unlock advanced reasoning and problem-solving abilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📈 Achieve better quality outputs through better quality inputs**  \n",
    "  The precision of your prompts directly impacts the quality of results\n",
