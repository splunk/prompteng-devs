## üîë Key Differences from Security-Only Review

| Aspect | Security-Only Review | Comprehensive Review |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Focus Areas** | Vulnerabilities, attack vectors | Security + Performance + Quality + Best Practices |
| **Role** | Security Engineer, AppSec Specialist | Senior Software Engineer with broad expertise |
| **Depth** | Deep dive into security (OWASP, CWE) | Balanced across multiple dimensions |
| **Standards** | OWASP Top 10, CWE, CVE | Language best practices, design patterns, common sense |
| **Severity** | Based on exploitability | Based on impact across all dimensions |
| **Use Case** | Security-critical changes | General code review |

---

## üìã Expected Findings for Test Code

When you run this template on the test authentication code, you should see:

### CRITICAL: SQL Injection in User Lookup
**Category:** Security  
**Lines:** 8  
**Issue:** Directly interpolating `username` into the SQL query enables injection attacks  
**Impact:** Attackers can bypass authentication or read/modify arbitrary user data  
**Fix:** Use parameterized queries or ORM helpers with bound parameters

### CRITICAL: Weak Password Hashing (MD5)
**Category:** Security  
**Lines:** 12  
**Issue:** MD5 is a broken hashing algorithm that is trivial to crack  
**Impact:** Leaked hashes expose all user passwords within minutes  
**Fix:** Replace with a password hashing library (e.g., `bcrypt`, `argon2`) and add salting

### MAJOR: Predictable Session Tokens
**Category:** Security / Best Practices  
**Lines:** 18  
**Issue:** Session tokens are generated from user id + seconds timestamp, making them guessable  
**Impact:** Attackers can hijack active sessions by predicting token values  
**Fix:** Use cryptographically secure random token generation

### MAJOR: Performance Bottlenecks in Permission Loading
**Category:** Performance  
**Lines:** 21-24, 26  
**Issue:** Loops fetch each role individually (`db.has_role`) and introduce a blocking `time.sleep(0.5)` per login  
**Impact:** Causes N+1 database access patterns and unnecessary latency under load  
**Fix:** Batch-fetch permissions and remove or justify the artificial sleep

### MAJOR: Fragile Handling of Query Results and Global State
**Category:** Maintainability / Correctness  
**Lines:** 9, 16, 27  
**Issue:** Accessing `rows[0]` without checking for empty results raises exceptions, and a module-level cache couples sessions to process memory  
**Impact:** Leads to crashes for unknown users, memory leaks, and inconsistent state in multi-instance deployments  
**Fix:** Add explicit handling for missing users and replace global cache with scoped session storage

### Quick Reference: Issues by Dimension

| Dimension | Signals in Sample Diff | Suggested Focus |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Security | SQL injection query, MD5 hashing, timestamp-based session tokens | Parameterized queries, modern hashing algorithms, secure token generation |
| Performance | N+1 role lookups, `time.sleep(0.5)` | Batch permission fetches, remove blocking calls |
| Maintainability / Correctness | `rows[0]` without checks, global `SESSION_CACHE` | Defensive coding for empty data, encapsulated session management |
| Error Handling | No validation for DB results or exceptions | Add guard clauses, return meaningful error responses |

**Remember**: This template is a **first-pass review tool** to catch common issues and provide helpful feedback. It complements but doesn't replace human code review, especially for complex architectural decisions.
