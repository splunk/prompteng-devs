        "   - Review queues delay feature delivery by 2-3 days on average\n",
        "   - **Impact:** Slower velocity, frustrated developers\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **üéØ Inconsistent Standards**\n",
        "   - Different reviewers prioritize different concerns\n",
        "   - New team members lack institutional knowledge\n",
        "   - Review quality varies based on reviewer fatigue\n",

        "   - Review reasoning buried in PR comments\n",

        "1. **Identify fixed content** - Instructions that never change (e.g., \"Act as a Senior Backend Engineer\")\n",
        "2. **Identify variable content** - Dynamic data that changes per request (e.g., code diffs, repository names)\n",
