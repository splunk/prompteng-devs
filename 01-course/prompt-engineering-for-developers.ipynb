    "## Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals for Developers** course is designed to equip engineers with the foundational knowledge and practical skills in Large Language Model (LLM) interaction patterns and best practices. It focuses on the core techniques required to design and optimize effective LLM prompts for various during various stages of SDLC. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience:  \n",
    "\n",
    "All engineers within the Products & Technology organization who are keen to develop or enhance their foundational prompt engineering skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful completion of this course, engineers will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up and configure a local development environment for executing prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply foundational prompting techniques—zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought—to create clear instructions for accurate LLM responses in software engineering tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Craft advanced prompt structures—role prompting, delimiters, and reference text—to reduce hallucinations in software engineering tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Write effective prompts for software engineering tasks that support code quality, testing, and API integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Integrate prompt-based slash commands for code review, branch analysis, and performance debugging with OpenAI Codex or Claude Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python is recommended, but experienced software developers with proficiency in another programming language will be able to follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "- API Access: Prefer CircuIT APIs (any tier) for this course. If you do not have CircuIT access, you can use GitHub Copilot via the local API proxy. Follow `GitHub-Copilot-2-API/README.md` to authenticate and start the local server, then run the \"GitHub Copilot (local proxy)\" setup cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Development Environment: A local development setup is necessary, including Python, IDE (VS Code or Cursor) with their built-in notebook support.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Claude Code or OpenAI Codex access to implement custom command integration. \n",

    "## Why Code Assistants Excel with Structured Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompt engineering transforms AI code assistants from basic code generators into sophisticated development partners. Research shows that well-structured prompts can improve code quality by 40-60% and reduce error rates by up to 35% compared to unstructured requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Structured Prompt Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "When interacting with AI code assistants like OpenAI Codex, Claude, or GitHub Copilot, structured prompts provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Context Processing** - AI models process and retain information more effectively when presented in organized formats\n",
    "- **Reduced Ambiguity** - Clear specifications minimize misinterpretations and assumptions\n",
    "- **Consistent Mental Models** - Well-structured prompts help the AI build more accurate representations of your requirements\n",
    "- **Improved Problem Decomposition** - Systematic approaches help tackle complex problems more effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool-Calling Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI code assistants provide advanced tool-calling capabilities not available when using LLMs directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File System Integration** - Reading, writing, and modifying code files directly\n",
    "- **Code Execution** - Running code and returning results within the prompt context\n",
    "- **Contextual Analysis** - Analyzing entire codebases and repository structures\n",
    "- **Extended Intelligence** - Accessing external tools and APIs for enhanced functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "These capabilities can be further extended by integrating various MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers, allowing teams to connect specialized tools for their development workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom Commands: From Prompts to Reusable Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom commands transform these proven prompt engineering patterns into reusable, shareable tools. Instead of repeatedly crafting complex prompts, you create standardized shortcuts that maintain consistency and quality across your entire engineering organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Strategic Benefits for Engineering Teams**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency** - Ensure standardized approaches to common tasks across team members\n",
    "- **Knowledge Transfer** - Encode best practices into tools accessible to junior and senior developers alike\n",
    "- **Efficiency** - Reduce cognitive load by automating prompt creation for routine tasks\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance** - Enforce quality standards by embedding them directly in commands\n",
