## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Completion of [01-course/](../01-course/) modules 1-3
- Practical experience with integrated exercises in the course modules
- Understanding of your target AI assistant platform (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)

### Selection Guide
Choose examples based on your immediate needs:

**For Code Quality Focus:**
- Start with `code-quality/legacy-modernization` for refactoring patterns
- Progress to `code-quality/architecture-refactoring` for larger changes

**For Debugging Skills:**
- Begin with `debugging/incident-investigation` for systematic troubleshooting
- Advance to `debugging/performance-analysis` for optimization workflows

**For API Development:**
- Start with `api-integration/client-generation` for SDK creation patterns
- Continue with `api-integration/error-handling` for robust implementations

**For Team Integration:**
- Begin with `custom-commands/platform-specific` for individual productivity  
- Scale to `custom-commands/team-workflows` for organization-wide adoption

## Implementation Approach

1. **Understand the Scenario** - Review the business context and technical requirements
2. **Examine the Implementation** - Study the complete prompt engineering solution
3. **Test the Pattern** - Execute the examples in your own environment
4. **Adapt to Your Context** - Modify patterns for your specific use cases
5. **Share and Iterate** - Refine based on team feedback and real-world usage

## Integration with AI Assistants

Examples include platform-specific adaptations for:

- **GitHub Copilot** - `.github/prompts/` organization and slash command patterns
- **Claude Code** - `.claude/commands/` structure with allowed-tools configuration  
- **VS Code Extensions** - Custom command integration and workflow automation
- **Generic Patterns** - Platform-agnostic implementations for broad compatibility

## Success Metrics

Track the effectiveness of implemented patterns:
- **Development Velocity** - Time saved on common tasks
- **Code Quality** - Reduced bugs, improved maintainability
- **Team Consistency** - Standardized approaches across developers
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Effective prompt libraries and documentation

## Contributing New Examples

When adding new use cases:
1. **Include Complete Context** - Business requirements, technical constraints, success criteria
2. **Provide Working Implementation** - Tested prompts and code that actually work
3. **Document Adaptation Process** - How to modify for different scenarios
4. **Add Platform Variations** - Examples for multiple AI assistant platforms
5. **Include Success Measurements** - How to evaluate effectiveness

## Next Steps

- **Apply to Current Projects** - Integrate patterns into your active development work
- **Create Team Standards** - Establish prompt engineering guidelines for your organization  
- **Build Custom Libraries** - Develop organization-specific prompt collections
- **Measure and Iterate** - Track effectiveness and continuously improve patterns
